# Squake

**Neoforge (1.21) port coming soon™**

Squake is client-side mod for Minecraft Forge/ Fabric which adds bunnyhopping, strafe jumping, air control, trimping, and sharking. It also can disable the loss of speed when taking fall damage (needs to be installed server-side).

The modified movement code is based on Quake and Half-Life's code, with the the goal to make the movement feel the same as Half-Life.

## Features

-   **Bunnyhopping**  - Uncapped by default, but you can apply soft and hard speed caps.
-   **Trimping**  - If you're moving fast enough, pressing sneak will convert some of your horizontal speed into vertical speed. 
-   **Sharking**  - Allows gliding across the surface of water by holding jump. The surface tension and friction of the water are configurable.
